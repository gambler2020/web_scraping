Like many families in Argentina, his family greatly loved football. That love transcended into a passion in young Messi who began playing football at a very young age with his brothers and cousins. At the age of 4, in a bid to follow the passion which burned in him, he joined Grandoli, where he remained until he moved to Newell’s Old Boys at age 6. At Newell, his exceptional goal-scoring form came to the fore as he registered 500 goals in 6 years.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><p>Messi’s football career was however threatened by a growth hormone deficiency. His parents were unable to afford the treatment. Newell sought to sponsor his treatment but soon backed down. River Plate, an Argentinean club also sought to sponsor his treatment but were unable due to the country’s economic crisis. After he had a trial with Barcelona, where he impressed the directors, the club soon signed him and began sponsoring his treatment. Away from home and homesick, Messi struggled to settle in Spain but soon found solace in his friendship with Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique who were all youth players then.</p><p>Upon completing his growth hormone deficiency treatment, he released the beast in himself after he delivered an overwhelming impressive performance in the 2002/03, helping Barcelona youth side with a treble and ranking as the league’s top scorer. </p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"career-summary\"></span><strong>Career Summary</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2><p>Through 2003 to 2005, Messi played irregularly for Barcelona’s first team. His skill caught the attention of top first team stars such as <a href=\"https://sportytell.com/biography/ronaldinho-biography-facts-childhood-life-net-worth/\">Ronaldinho</a> who befriended him. At the age of 18, he signed a professional contract, his first senior contract with Barcelona, with a buyout clause of €150 million. For the first few seasons he spent as a first team player, Messi achieved considerable success and earned severl plaudits for his football Ingenuity such as his 2006/07 season goal which bears stunning similarity to the Goal of the 20th Century scored by Argentinean legend, Diego Maradona.</p><p>After his maiden Ballon d’Or win in 2009 he went on to win three more FIFA Ballon d’Or awards between 2010 to 2012 and thus emerged as the first player in history to record 4 Ballon d’Or wins. His achievement catapulted him to a whole new level in his career as he was compared with the likes of legendary footballers such as <a href=\"https://sportytell.com/biography/pele-biography-facts-childhood-career-personal-life/\">Pele</a>. With Barcelona’s continental success halted, Messi had to wait for years before he won another Ballon d’Or. He however won the European Golden Shoe and also the 2014 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball.</p><p>At the World Cup, Argentina made it to the final, but a goal defeat denied Messi a chance to clinch World Cup glory, a feat which will have solidly balanced his achievements. Motivated by his defeat in the World Cup, Messi returned to the Laliga for the 2015 season in the most prolific form ever, which saw him emerge as the league’s all-time top scorer and also leading Barcelona to a second continental treble, the first team to achieve the feat. He then won his fifth Ballon d’Or award.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><p>From 2016 to 2019, Messi failed to achieve continental glory.

At both teams, Messi who clads the no. 10 jersey has solidly placed himself as a noteworthy figure in the team. An ingenious player, Lionel Messi who currently is the <a href=\"https://sportytell.com/football/projecting-top-25-best-football-players-in-the-world-2020/\">best footballer in the world</a> and also a viable contender for the title of the <a href=\"https://sportytell.com/football/top-10-greatest-football-players-of-all-time/\">Greatest Footballer of All Time (GOAT)</a>, has displayed his unusual football prowess that none can argue that the star isn’t phenomenal.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><p>With an emphasis on Lionel Messi’s net worth in 2020, we briefly summarize the wealth his career has created for him. Other major highlights in this article include his early life, career summary, career highlights, salary, endorsements and sponsorships, luxury lifestyle, houses, vehicular assets and our takeaways from Lionel Messi’s wealth and rise to fame.</p><h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"early-life\"></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2><p>Born to a family with a humble background, his father worked in a steel factory, while his mother worked in a workshop where magnets were manufactured. Like many families in Argentina, his family greatly loved football. That love transcended into a passion in young Messi who began playing football at a very young age with his brothers and cousins. At the age of 4, in a bid to follow the passion which burned in him, he joined Grandoli, where he remained until he moved to Newell’s Old Boys at age 6. At Newell, his exceptional goal-scoring form came to the fore as he registered 500 goals in 6 years.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><p>Messi’s football career was however threatened by a growth hormone deficiency. His parents were unable to afford the treatment. Newell sought to sponsor his treatment but soon backed down. River Plate, an Argentinean club also sought to sponsor his treatment but were unable due to the country’s economic crisis. After he had a trial with Barcelona, where he impressed the directors, the club soon signed him and began sponsoring his treatment. Away from home and homesick, Messi struggled to settle in Spain but soon found solace in his friendship with Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique who were all youth players then.</p><p>Upon completing his growth hormone deficiency treatment, he released the beast in himself after he delivered an overwhelming impressive performance in the 2002/03, helping Barcelona youth side with a treble and ranking as the league’s top scorer. </p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"career-summary\"></span><strong>Career Summary</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2><p>Through 2003 to 2005, Messi played irregularly for Barcelona’s first team. His skill caught the attention of top first team stars such as <a href=\"https://sportytell.com/biography/ronaldinho-biography-facts-childhood-life-net-worth/\">Ronaldinho</a> who befriended him. At the age of 18, he signed a professional contract, his first senior contract with Barcelona, with a buyout clause of €150 million. For the first few seasons he spent as a first team player, Messi achieved considerable success and earned severl plaudits for his football Ingenuity such as his 2006/07 season goal which bears stunning similarity to the Goal of the 20th Century scored by Argentinean legend, Diego Maradona.</p><p>After his maiden Ballon d’Or win in 2009 he went on to win three more FIFA Ballon d’Or awards between 2010 to 2012 and thus emerged as the first player in history to record 4 Ballon d’Or wins. His achievement catapulted him to a whole new level in his career as he was compared with the likes of legendary footballers such as <a href=\"https://sportytell.com/biography/pele-biography-facts-childhood-career-personal-life/\">Pele</a>. With Barcelona’s continental success halted, Messi had to wait for years before he won another Ballon d’Or. He however won the European Golden Shoe and also the 2014 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball.</p><p>At the World Cup, Argentina made it to the final, but a goal defeat denied Messi a chance to clinch World Cup glory, a feat which will have solidly balanced his achievements. Motivated by his defeat in the World Cup, Messi returned to the Laliga for the 2015 season in the most prolific form ever, which saw him emerge as the league’s all-time top scorer and also leading Barcelona to a second continental treble, the first team to achieve the feat. He then won his fifth Ballon d’Or award.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2154435006208246\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2290708573\" style=\"display:block\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div><p>From 2016 to 2019, Messi failed to achieve continental glory. From 2016 to 2018, Messi finished in the runner-up spot in the Ballon d’Or and Best FIFA Men’s Player Award.

      "\n",
      "Lionel Messi is a professional footballer who plays in the Spanish league La Liga, for Barcelona and also for the Argentinean National Football team. At both teams, Messi who clads the no. 10 jersey has solidly placed himself as a noteworthy figure in the team. An ingenious player, Lionel Messi who currently is the best footballer in the world and also a viable contender for the title of the Greatest Footballer of All Time (GOAT), has displayed his unusual football prowess that none can argue that the star isn’t phenomenal.\n",
      "With an emphasis on Lionel Messi’s net worth in 2020, we briefly summarize the wealth his career has created for him. Other major highlights in this article include his early life, career summary, career highlights, salary, endorsements and sponsorships, luxury lifestyle, houses, vehicular assets and our takeaways from Lionel Messi’s wealth and rise to fame.\n",
      "Born to a family with a humble background, his father worked in a steel factory, while his mother worked in a workshop where magnets were manufactured. Like many families in Argentina, his family greatly loved football. That love transcended into a passion in young Messi who began playing football at a very young age with his brothers and cousins. At the age of 4, in a bid to follow the passion which burned in him, he joined Grandoli, where he remained until he moved to Newell’s Old Boys at age 6. At Newell, his exceptional goal-scoring form came to the fore as he registered 500 goals in 6 years.\n",
      "Messi’s football career was however threatened by a growth hormone deficiency. His parents were unable to afford the treatment. Newell sought to sponsor his treatment but soon backed down. River Plate, an Argentinean club also sought to sponsor his treatment but were unable due to the country’s economic crisis. After he had a trial with Barcelona, where he impressed the directors, the club soon signed him and began sponsoring his treatment. Away from home and homesick, Messi struggled to settle in Spain but soon found solace in his friendship with Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique who were all youth players then.\n",
      "Upon completing his growth hormone deficiency treatment, he released the beast in himself after he delivered an overwhelming impressive performance in the 2002/03, helping Barcelona youth side with a treble and ranking as the league’s top scorer.\n",
      "Through 2003 to 2005, Messi played irregularly for Barcelona’s first team. His skill caught the attention of top first team stars such as Ronaldinho who befriended him. At the age of 18, he signed a professional contract, his first senior contract with Barcelona, with a buyout clause of €150 million. For the first few seasons he spent as a first team player, Messi achieved considerable success and earned severl plaudits for his football Ingenuity such as his 2006/07 season goal which bears stunning similarity to the Goal of the 20th Century scored by Argentinean legend, Diego Maradona.\n",
      "After his maiden Ballon d’Or win in 2009 he went on to win three more FIFA Ballon d’Or awards between 2010 to 2012 and thus emerged as the first player in history to record 4 Ballon d’Or wins. His achievement catapulted him to a whole new level in his career as he was compared with the likes of legendary footballers such as Pele. With Barcelona’s continental success halted, Messi had to wait for years before he won another Ballon d’Or. He however won the European Golden Shoe and also the 2014 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball.\n",
      "At the World Cup, Argentina made it to the final, but a goal defeat denied Messi a chance to clinch World Cup glory, a feat which will have solidly balanced his achievements. Motivated by his defeat in the World Cup, Messi returned to the Laliga for the 2015 season in the most prolific form ever, which saw him emerge as the league’s all-time top scorer and also leading Barcelona to a second continental treble, the first team to achieve the feat. He then won his fifth Ballon d’Or award.\n",
      "From 2016 to 2019, Messi failed to achieve continental glory. From 2016 to 2018, Messi finished in the runner-up spot in the Ballon d’Or and Best FIFA Men’s Player Award. Despite his Ballon d’Or flop, Messi remained a very valuable asset for Barcelona as his 2017 $667,000 weekly five years contract which saw his buyout clause move from $357 million to $857 million revealed.\n",
      "Though he saw considerable success at club level, his lack of success in Europe saw rival Cristiano Ronaldo who claimed three successive UEFA Champions League title with Real Madrid win the Ballon d’Or and Best FIFA Men’s Player Award, in 2016 and 2017, with exception to 2018, where for the first time in a decade, neither Messi nor Ronaldo clinched the title.\n",
      "In the 2018 Ballon d’Or and Best FIFA Men’s Player Award, Messi failed to finish in the final three. He made up for his loss in the Ballon d’Or and Best FIFA Men’s Player Award, in 2019 where he led as captain to an impressive league win and also clinch his sixth European Golden Boot award. For his achievements, he went on to clinch a historic sixth Ballon d’Or award and his first Best FIFA Men’s Player Award. Messi has since been in prolific form.\n",

Like many families in Argentina, his family greatly loved football. That love transcended into a passion in young Messi who began playing football at a very young age with his brothers and cousins. At the age of 4, in a bid to follow the passion which burned in him, he joined Grandoli, where he remained until he moved to Newell’s Old Boys at age 6. At Newell, his exceptional goal-scoring form came to the fore as he registered 500 goals in 6 years.   (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Messi’s football career was however threatened by a growth hormone deficiency. His parents were unable to afford the treatment. Newell sought to sponsor his treatment but soon backed down. River Plate, an Argentinean club also sought to sponsor his treatment but were unable due to the country’s economic crisis. After he had a trial with Barcelona, where he impressed the directors, the club soon signed him and began sponsoring his treatment. Away from home and homesick, Messi struggled to settle in Spain but soon found solace in his friendship with Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique who were all youth players then.Upon completing his growth hormone deficiency treatment, he released the beast in himself after he delivered an overwhelming impressive performance in the 2002/03, helping Barcelona youth side with a treble and ranking as the league’s top scorer.    (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Career SummaryThrough 2003 to 2005, Messi played irregularly for Barcelona’s first team.
